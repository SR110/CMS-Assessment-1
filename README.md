# Introdution 
Through this project, I have created and hosted two sites based on different business ideas. Having a layout that is very similar to that of the Joomla website, the WordPress website focusses on an idea that caters to the ladies who opt for sustainable fashion. The Joomla website, on the other hand, focusses on sports gear and equipment that aids athletes and adults who are overweight in exercising.


# 1 - WordPress Website
The escalating trend of excessive apparel consumption has led to a pressing issue regarding the substantial amount of clothing discarded each year in developed countries. The countries I chose to focus on are Singapore, USA and Australia. I selected these places because the majority residing there chooses fast fashion over green fashion. I feel that this is done because of the extremely busy urban life that lead. With the large number of different meetings and events, working professionals, especially those aged between 25 and 40 years old, have a tendency of over-buying clothes. This also leads to more clothes being discarded, further leading to other problems such as pollution, deforestation, excessive water usage and waste management issues.

## The 4Ps
Product: The Product, I chose to base my business on, is sustainable clothing. Clothing that is made in an eco-friendly way and does not adversely affect the environment. 

Price: The Price of our collection is very reasonable and is kept affordable so that people from all socio-economic groups can make a purchase and do not leave empty-handed.

Place: The Places of focus are Singapore, USA and Australia as they are developed countries with a lot of apparel that is discarded. The group of people in these places, generally, purchase a lot more than they require and then end up discarding the same lot, in a careless manner.

Promotion: The Promotion factor and USP (Unique Selling Point) is that our clothing is made affordable which means our message of green fashion can reach the masses and a culture is built in the targeted countries in which people make green fashion a choice and way of life.


## STP
Segmentation: Our website is made for the middle income group of people who are aware of the problem of fast fashion and are willing to invest in a better way of living ie. Sustainable Fashion.

Targeting: Targeting the working professionals who often have the urge to buy a lot of apparel, our brand aims at helping people have a guilt-free shopping experience.

Positioning: What sets our brand apart from the rest of the businesses is that our designs are unique and cannot be matched. On top of that, we source the raw materials in a responsible way, not damaging the earth and it's resources as much.  


## Learning Activities & Resources
After having done the practical on WordPress, I was better equipped with the necessary skills to do this assignment. Despite this, I was not too sure about some aspects of the software such as the hosting part.
For hosting, I used Pantheon which was easy-to-use hosting platform recommended by my peer in Tutorial.

## Estimated hours
The estimated time taken for the WordPress website is 2 days. I did a lot of research and faced a lot of setbacks. But, the experience was worthwhile and taught me a lot.

## Content Insights
The content focusses on attracting nature-lovers and people who are willing to do their part for the environnment. The term on the banner - Green Fashion - catches the attention of visitors and converts them into shoppers and customers who do not leave with an empty cart. The 60% discount also lures the visitors who come to our site.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I can confidently say that I have acquired enough industry relevant skills such as being resilient when certain aspects of the website are not working and troubleshooting. I have also learnt how to channelise my ideas into making a complete website that serves the desired purpose.

# 2 - Joomla Website
For the Joomla website, I chose to focus on sports gear since I was in my school's basketball team and had a deep interest for the sport. But, since the gear we used was of poor quality and expensive, I wanted to resolve this issue and make gear accessible to the athletes of the Sports School of Singapore or other people who are currently in their fitness journey. We have a wide range of sports gear and equipment such as running shoes, swimsuits and even cycles.

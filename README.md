# Introdution 
Through this project, I have created and hosted two sites based on different business ideas. Having a layout that is very similar to that of the Joomla website, the WordPress website focusses on an idea that caters to the ladies who opt for sustainable fashion. The Joomla website, on the other hand, focusses on sports gear and equipment that aids athletes and adults who are overweight in exercising.

## The 4Ps
Product: The Product, I chose to base my business on, is sustainable clothing. With the ever increasing trend of buying apparel excessively,  has become a pressing issue to do something about the amount of clothing that is discarded every year in developed countries. The countries I chose to focus on are Singapore, USA and Australia. I selected these places because the majority residing there chooses fast fashion over green fashion. I feel that this is done because of the extremely busy urban life that lead. With the large number of different meetings and events, working professionals, especially those aged between 25 and 40 years old, have a tendency of over-buying clothes.

Price: The Price of our collection is very reasonable and is kept affordable so that everyone can buy it.

Place: The Places of focus are Singapore, USA and Australia as they are developed countries with a lot of apparel that is discarded.
